# Lipstick RCM AI Chat
## Overview

The goal of my project is to create a beauty product recommendation system, specifically focused on suggesting lipsticks based on seasonal color trends. The system is designed as an interactive website integrated with a chatbot, allowing users to receive personalized lipstick recommendations. Users can first take a color test to determine their personal palette, and then provide additional preferences to the chatbot. Based on this information, the chatbot will suggest the most suitable lipstick shades tailored to their individual needs and the current seasonal trends. This project aims to enhance the online shopping experience by combining color theory with AI-driven personalization, offering users a seamless and personalized beauty product discovery journey.

## Features

- **Quantized Model Integration**: This app uses what are called "quantized models." These are special because they are designed to work well on regular consumer hardware, like the kind most of us have at home or in our offices. Normally, the original versions of these models are really big and need more powerful computers to run them. But quantized models are optimized to be smaller and more efficient, without losing much performance. This means you can use this app and its features without needing a super powerful computer.

- **Audio Chatting with Whisper AI**: Leveraging Whisper AI's robust transcription capabilities, this app offers a sophisticated audio messaging experience. The integration of Whisper AI allows for accurate interpretation and response to voice inputs, enhancing the natural flow of conversations.

- **PDF Chatting with Chroma DB**: The app is tailored for both professional and academic uses, integrating Chroma DB as a vector database for efficient PDF interactions. This feature allows users to engage with their own PDF files locally on their device. Whether it's for reviewing business reports, academic papers, or any other PDF document, the app offers a seamless experience. It provides an effective way for users to interact with their PDFs, leveraging the power of AI to understand and respond to content within these documents. This makes it a valuable tool for personal use, where one can extract insights, summaries, and engage in a unique form of dialogue with the text in their PDF files.
